# LinearAlgebra_HK242

This repository contains documents and structured Jupyter example code for each section of the [Linear Algebra](https://d2l.ai/chapter_preliminaries/linear-algebra.html) chapter from the *Dive into Deep Learning* book. The contents are organized into three main parts: **Reports** (full document and presentation slides), **Sections** (code examples), and **Exercises** (practice problems within the chapter).

## Reports

- A full written report (PDF format)
- A presentation slide (PDF format)
