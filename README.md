# LinearAlgebra_HK242

This repository contains structured Jupyter example code for each section of the [Linear Algebra](https://d2l.ai/chapter_preliminaries/linear-algebra.html) chapter from the *Dive into Deep Learning* book. It is organized into two main parts: **Sections** (Code example) and **Exercises** (only practice problems required code).

## Sections

Each numbered notebook corresponds to a section in the Linear Algebra chapter:

| No. | Notebook | Description |
|-----|----------|-------------|
| 1 | `1_Scalars.ipynb` | Introduction to scalars and their role in tensor computations. |
| 2 | `2_Vectors.ipynb` | Covers vector definitions, basic operations, and representations. |
| 3 | `3_Matrices.ipynb` | Matrix basics, indexing, and element-wise operations. |
| 4 | `4_Tensors.ipynb` | Generalization of scalars, vectors, and matrices to higher-order tensors. |
| 5 | `5_Basic_Properties_of_Tensor_Arithmetic.ipynb` | Commutativity, associativity, and distributivity in tensor arithmetic. |
| 6 | `6_Reduction_Operations.ipynb` | Operations like sum, mean, and max that reduce tensor dimensions. |
| 7 | `7_Non-reduction_Operations.ipynb` | Element-wise operations that preserve tensor shape. |
| 8 | `8_Dot_Product.ipynb` | Dot product concepts and applications in projections and similarity. |
| 9 | `9_Matrix–Vector_Products.ipynb` | Linear transformations via matrix–vector multiplication. |
| 10 | `10_Matrix–Matrix_Multiplication.ipynb` | Concepts and use cases of multiplying two matrices. |
